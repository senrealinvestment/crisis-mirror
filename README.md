# Crisis Mirror

**Smart glasses ambient AI — cognitive companion for clinical medicine**  
Real-time cue + cost/quality feedback loop for transplant ICU / critical care.

## Concept

Ambient **audio** (glasses mics and/or phone) → **phone/iPad edge brain** (local protocol pack + safety gate) → discrete cue (**HUD text + tone**) → clinician action → post-hoc labels (*helpful?* *accurate?*) for **offline** training.

Optional **OpenEvidence / UpToDate-class** APIs = deep consult after a trigger — not continuous cloud listening.

### Design law: no wearable camera (v1)

Face-worn video is a PHI / consent / unit-culture problem.  
**v1 senses with sound only.** Visual context is out of scope until separately approved.

### Where the brain lives

| Layer | Device | Role |
|-------|--------|------|
| Thin wearable | Smart glasses (**no camera**) | Mics + HUD (+ bone conduction if present) |
| Edge brain | iPhone / iPad nearby | Real-time detect + local protocols + safety + label UI |
| Deep consult | Secure cloud APIs | Broader evidence on demand (stripped queries) |

## Hardware lean

| Path | Device | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| **Clinical / privacy-native** | [Even Realities G2](https://www.evenrealities.com/) | **No camera**, HUD + mics; tone via phone or BC earbuds (G2 has no speakers) |
| **Open-source build** | [Brilliant Labs Halo](https://brilliant.xyz/) | Open stack + onboard bone conduction; **camera hard-off** for clinical mode |
| **Before any glasses** | Phone only | Mic + headphones + on-screen HUD — valid sim path |

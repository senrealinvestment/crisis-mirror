# Cognitive Companion v1 — cited evidence brief

**Scope (Link):** camera-free HUD + audio/bone-conduction cueing in anesthesia/critical-care sim, versus wearable video; live Halo vs Even G2 capability/availability; implications for Cognitive Companion v1 only. Cites-only. No code.

**v1 frame used here:** Crisis Mirror’s published one-pager is audio-in → phone brain → HUD + tone, with no wearable camera. This brief does not re-litigate that product choice; it tests it against live literature and live hardware pages.

**Date of retrieval:** 2026-08-17.

## Bottom line

1. In anesthesia sim, **advanced auditory displays beat a HUD** for event detection when the anesthesiologist is distracted; adding a HUD on top of audio does not add much.[1]
2. A **HUD still changes gaze** toward the patient and can speed event detection when the wearer is physically busy.[2][3][5]
It can also raise alarm notice for a supervising anesthesiologist, with a documented distraction cost during demanding procedures.[4]
3. **Wearable-video / see-what-I-see Glass** is a different product: mostly recording and remote consult. It did **not** shorten time-to-first-shock or no-flow in the two pediatric-arrest sims retrieved here; it did cut some dose/technique errors.[6][7][8]
4. **Even G2** is the live camera-free HUD (36 g, four mics, $599, customize / HSA-FSA language). Official pages do **not** specify speakers or bone conduction.[20][21]
5. **Brilliant Halo** is the live bone-conduction pair (just over 40 g, $399) **and it has a 640×480 camera**. Brilliant’s hardware page says the devices are **not verified** for uses where performance would be critical to human health or safety.[18][19]
6. **Patent corpus not retrieved.** Google Patents / Lens HTML returns were empty. Even’s G2 page claims a “patented screwless hinge” with no patent number.[20]

## 1. Camera-free HUD + audio cueing (anesthesia / critical-care sim)

### 1.1 Auditory displays vs HUD vs standard visual monitor

Sanderson et al. (2008), full-scale anesthesia simulator, 16 residents/attendings, reading distractor: event detection was Audio mean 90% / median 100%, Both (Audio+HMD) mean 92% / median 100%, HMD-only mean 75% / median 67% (ns vs visual), Visual mean 52% / median 50%. Detection *time* did not differ. Authors’ conclusion: advanced auditory displays help the distracted anesthesiologist; an HMD does not significantly improve performance.[1]

That is the single strongest v1-relevant RCT-style sim result retrieved: **tone/sonification is the load-bearing channel when attention is off the monitor**. A HUD is a weaker add-on in that specific distracted-supervisor design.[unverified]

### 1.2 HUD when the wearer is busy, not reading

Liu, Jenkins, Sanderson et al. (2009), two simulator experiments: wearing an HMD did not reduce event detection in naturalistic OR scenarios; when physically constrained on a part-task trainer, participants detected two of four events faster with the HMD and one event more slowly.[2]

Liu’s 2009 review of the same program: anesthesiologists detect patient events faster with an HMD when busy performing procedures, but not during normal monitoring. No evidence in that program of inattentional-blindness cost from the HMD.[5]

Liu et al. (2010), clinical OR evaluation (6 attendings, 36 rigid-cystoscopy cases, Microvision Nomad ND2000 + Philips MP70): with the HMD, time looking at the workstation fell 25.3% → 21.0% (P = 0.003) and time looking at the patient/field rose 51.5% → 55.9% (P = 0.014). Frequency and duration of looks did not change. Authors: more research needed before claiming outcome benefit.[3]

Schlosser et al. (2019), proof-of-concept multiple-OR supervision (8 supervising anesthesiologists, 3 h with / 3 h without a head-worn display): alarm notice 66.7% with the display vs 7.1% without (P = 0.028). Authors also report a tendency of the display to distract during demanding procedures.[4]

A 1995 preliminary OR evaluation of a monochrome headband HUD (11 anesthesiologists, one day) is historical only: most users adapted in about 15 minutes; complaints were cable length, resolution, and unfamiliar layout.[16]

Elrose / Sanderson systematic review (2021, 15 studies, 1995–2020): all 7 studies that measured gaze found gaze-direction changes with head-worn displays; 2 of 3 change-detection studies found improvements; in 7 of 10 ease-of-use studies most participants called the device easy to use; participants who were asked said they would consider clinical use but often wanted hardware/display changes.[24]

Andrade et al. (2021) review of wearable clinician monitors (20 studies): three device classes — tactile, head-mounted, smartwatch. HMDs judged potentially useful mainly on ergonomics (less gaze aversion from the patient). Tactile displays showed monitoring potential but comfort blocked clinical use.[11]

**Inference (labeled):** v1’s HUD is justified as a *busy-hands / eyes-on-patient* aid, not as the primary detection channel. v1’s tone channel is the one with the cleaner sim signal.[unverified]

### 1.3 Cognitive aids (paper / digital) — adjacent, not HUD

Marshall (2006), simulated malignant hyperthermia: cognitive-aid use correlated with MH treatment score (CA-1 Spearman r = 0.59; CA-2 r = 0.68); the best teams used the aid extensively.[12]

Marshall (2013) review: 22 aids, 23 studies; 10 sim studies suggested better technical performance in MH, CPR, and airway; 3 sim evaluations showed no improvement or slower/wrong diagnoses; teamwork findings conflicted, including reduced communication in some teams.[13]

Schild et al. (2019): German digital intraoperative cognitive-aid design process (three prototypes).[14]

Goldhaber-Fiebert et al. (2016): Stanford implemented emergency manuals in ORs in fall 2012 (physical copies plus training); authors call this a nascent field in health care.[15]

Arriaga et al. (2013) exists on PubMed as “A simulation-based trial of surgical-crisis checklists.” The PubMed abstract field was empty and the NEJM full text was Cloudflare-blocked in this session, so **no effect sizes from that trial are cited here**.[17]

**Inference:** crisis-checklist evidence supports a *content* layer (what the companion says). It does not by itself justify glasses.[unverified]

## 2. Wearable video is the wrong analog for v1

Siebert et al. (2017), RCT, 20 pediatric residents, simulated pulseless VT, AR glasses vs PALS pocket cards: time to first defibrillation (mean 146 s) and other time-to-critical-action endpoints were **not** improved. Wrong defibrillation doses fell: without AR glasses 65% (26/40) wrong doses including 21 shocks >100 J; AR glasses reduced those errors 53% (21/40, P < .001) and cumulative dose 37%.[6]

Drummond et al. (2017), RCT, 42 first-year pediatric residents, Google Glass live video to a remote intensivist in simulated pediatric arrest: **no-blow and no-flow fractions were similar** vs usual care; insufflation effectiveness and compression technique/rate improved.[7]

Wei et al. (2018), systematic review of Google Glass in surgical settings (31 studies): 68% (21/31) used Glass as videography/photography; 19% (6/31) as a vital-sign monitor; 16% as navigation; 16% as intraoperative videoconference. Main limits: short battery 26% (8/31), hands-free difficulty 16% (5/31). Most were pilots; only 2/31 were RCTs.[8]

Zhang et al. (2022), interviews with 13 EMS providers: they frame smart glasses as hands-free + **see-what-I-see remote consultation**. Preferred input: voice and gestures, not the touchpad. Barriers named: hardware, human factors, reliability, workflow, interoperability, and **privacy**.[10]

Dougherty & Badawy (2017) reviewed Glass in nonsurgical settings: 51 included studies (21 patient-centered, 30 clinician-centered). That is a camera-first literature, not a camera-free HUD literature.[9]

**Inference:** do not treat Glass/AR-video papers as evidence for Cognitive Companion v1. They test a different job (record / telementor). Where they overlap (on-display cognitive aid), they improve **dose accuracy**, not speed.[unverified]

## 3. Live Halo vs Even G2 (retrieved 2026-08-17)

|  | **Even G2** | **Brilliant Halo** |
|---|---|---|
| Official posture | Camera-free by design; mic is the input.[20] | Open-source glasses **with a 640×480 camera** plus stereo bone conduction.[18][19] |
| Weight | 36 g.[20] | “just over than 40g” (vendor wording).[18] |
| Display | Green Micro LED, 640×350, 27.5° FoV, 1200 nits peak, 60 Hz, binocular waveguides, 98% passthrough.[20] | 0.2″ OLEDoS; 640×480 RGB panel; 256×256 drawable area; up to 5000 nit peak.[19] |
| Audio out | **Not specified** on the official spec / FAQ pages retrieved.[20] | Stereo bone-conduction speakers.[18][19] |
| Audio in | Four microphones; Conversate AI cues / transcribe / translate.[20] | Dual T5838 MEMS mics.[18][19] |
| Battery | Up to 2 days typical use; charging case holds seven full charges.[20] | 300 mAh (2×150 mAh); product FAQ claims all-day life at estimated normal use.[18][19] |
| Durability | IP65; drop-tested 2 m; hinge cycled 40,000 times.[20][22] | No IP rating on the hardware page retrieved.[19] |
| Price / buy | G2-A listed **$599**; customize / prescription paths; HSA/FSA language on the glasses page.[20][21] | **$399.00**.[18] |
| Ship status (this fetch) | Consumer product pages present it as buyable now.[20][21] | Same page: “shipments beginning in early August” and “Halo will begin shipping soon.”[18] |
| Safety / intended use | Consumer AI glasses; no medical-device claim on pages retrieved.[20] | Consumer/R&D; **not verified** where performance would be critical to human health, safety, or mission-critical use.[19] |
| Dev surface | Even Hub / SDK; MentraOS lists Even Realities as a supported hardware target.[20][23] | Zephyr OS + Lua VM; firmware described as fully open / GitHub on the product FAQ.[18][19] |

G2 FAQ, verbatim job-to-be-done: it has no camera “to prioritize your privacy” and “relies on its integrated microphone for information input rather than a camera.”[20]

Halo hardware page lists the VGA camera among core specs and, in the same document, states the devices are intended for consumer and R&D use and are not verified where performance would be critical to human health or safety.[19]

**Conflicts / gaps**

- Halo ship wording disagrees with itself on the same product page (“beginning early August” vs “will begin shipping soon”).[18]
- G2 speaker / bone-conduction capability is **unknown from official pages**. Repo language that G2 has “no speakers” was **not confirmed** here.[unverified]
- Neither device is a cleared medical monitor. Halo says so explicitly.[19]
- Mentra Live is the camera-on adjacent platform (43 g, HD camera, speakers, 3 mics) and claims MentraOS already supports Even Realities hardware — relevant as a software path, not as a v1 camera-free device.[23]

## 4. Similar projects (not v1, listed so they are not rediscovered as “new”)

| Cluster | What it actually is | Why it is not v1 |
|---|---|---|
| Sanderson / Liu HMD program (2008–2010, reviewed 2021) | Vital-sign HUD + sonification in anesthesia sim and one clinical series.[1][2][3] | Closest analog. Research program, not a shippable companion.[5][24] |
| Google Glass / AR-glasses PALS (Siebert, Drummond, Wei) | Camera + remote video or AR checklist overlay.[6][7][8] | Video-first; fails v1’s camera-free constraint. |
| EMS smart glasses (Zhang 2022) | See-what-I-see teleconsult + documentation.[10] | Camera + privacy surface. |
| Stanford emergency manuals / digital CAs (Marshall, Schild, Goldhaber-Fiebert) | Paper or tablet cognitive aids.[12][13][14] | Content layer only.[15] |
| Mentra Live | Camera-enabled open-source field glasses; MentraOS lists Even as a target.[23] | Camera-on; useful as an OS option if G2 is the HUD. |
| Even Conversate | On-device consumer AI cues from the mic, no camera.[20] | Consumer cousin of v1 audio-in → cue. Not clinical. |

## 5. Patents

**Unknown / blocked.** Targeted Google Patents and Lens.org HTML fetches in this session returned empty or near-empty bodies. No patent numbers are cited.

Even’s G2 page uses the phrase “Patented screwless hinge”; the tech page says screwless hinges were opened and closed 40,000 times. That is vendor copy, not a patent document.[20][22]

Do not treat “patented hinge” as freedom-to-operate, and do not treat the empty search as “no patents exist.”[unverified]

## 6. Implications for Cognitive Companion v1 only

These are inferences from the cites above, not new facts.

1. **Keep audio-in + tone as the detection channel.** Sanderson is the cleanest sim result retrieved, and it favors sonification over HUD when the wearer is distracted.[1]
2. **Keep a HUD as a busy-hands glance surface**, not as the pager. Liu/Schlosser support gaze-on-patient and alarm notice; Schlosser also documents distraction during hard procedures — so v1 HUD content should stay sparse.[2][3][4]
3. **G2 is the default v1 HUD hardware** among the two live devices: camera-free, lighter, IP65, buyable, four mics, on-device speech features. Confirm audio-out (or accept phone/Halo-only tones) before promising bone-conduction on G2.[20][21]
4. **Do not put Halo on a patient’s or clinician’s face as a camera.** Halo ships a VGA camera, and Brilliant says the devices are not verified where performance would be critical to human health or safety — a hard v1 reject for any in-sim “wearable video” path.[18][19]
5. **Halo is only a v1 audio-out fallback** if bone conduction is required and G2 cannot do it. That is a speaker accessory, not the companion’s eyes.[18][19]
6. **Do not cite Glass RCTs as v1 efficacy.** They are video/telementor trials. The transferable scrap is Siebert’s dose-error reduction from an on-display aid — which argues for checklist content, not a camera.[6][7]
7. **Ship the cognitive-aid content even if glasses slip.** Marshall / emergency-manual evidence does not need a HUD.[12][13][15]
8. **Privacy is already a named barrier** in the camera-on EMS literature. v1’s camera-free constraint is the feature that keeps that literature from applying.[10][20]
9. **No medical-device claim.** Neither Halo nor G2 is presented as a physiologic monitor. Liu 2010 is a display-of-existing-monitor study, not a new sensor.[3][19]
10. **Patent clearance is still open work.** This brief does not clear FTO.[22]

# Gaps and open questions for Sergio

2026-08-18. Things this pack cannot honestly close.

## Hardware

1. **How is Halo’s camera actually hard-off?** Docs describe the PixArt sensor and OTA firmware [3]. They do not describe a disable procedure. Is the plan a custom firmware image, a disconnected flex, a physical cover, or a software mute?
2. **Does G2 have speakers?** Re-fetched Even pages still have no audio-out line [4] [5] [6]. If the answer is no, the companion’s voice has to come from the phone.
3. **What is Halo runtime on 300 mAh in a noisy sim bay?** Capacity is stated [3]. Runtime is not.
4. **G2 battery / charge-case numbers** were not extracted this session [unverified].
5. **Can MentraOS run the companion on G2 without Mentra Live’s camera?** Mentra lists Even Realities as supported hardware [7]. App-level capability is untested here.
6. **Price collision.** Live Halo is $399 [1]. Older committed copy used $299–$349. Which number is in the $12.5k / $7.5k ask?

## Evidence

7. **No trial of this product class.** Closest HUD evidence is anesthesia vital-sign HMDs with process/gaze outcomes, not patient outcomes [18] [20] [35].
8. **Audio may beat HUD-alone** in one 2008 sim [18]. Has the team decided whether v1 is audio-first, HUD-first, or both?
9. **Checklist benefit is real in sim** (Arriaga 6% vs 23% missed steps [34]; PediAppRREST fewer deviations [45]). That is the *content*, not the glasses. What is the minimum viable content library for the first VCU session?
10. **Interruptibility metric is undefined.** What will you count as a harmful interruption vs a useful force function [38]?
11. Westbrook-style medication-interruption numbers were **not retrieved** this session [unverified]. Do not put them in the deck.

## Privacy / IRB / FDA

12. **QI or research?** VCU says most QI is not research, and to submit in VIRBs when unclear [16]. Is the first pilot a curriculum QI cycle or a publishable study?
13. **Who is the human subject?** Learners only? Faculty? Confederate SP? [unverified]
14. **Audio retention default?** On-device ephemeral vs transcript store vs vendor cloud. Even claims no cloud without consent [4]. That is marketing.
15. **Halo “Noa” memory** is on the product page [1]. Can it be off for a VCU image?
16. **FDA CDS 2026 guidance** flags time-critical use and automation bias [13]. Is the sim script going to show the *basis* of each cue, or just the cue?
17. HHS OCR wearable-audio pages were **HTTP 403** this session [unverified]. Someone with a browser session should pull them.

## Product / ops (outside researcher scope, still blocking)

18. OpenEvidence / UpToDate: license, offline, what the glasses are allowed to quote [unverified].
19. Edge brain: on-device model vs campus API vs vendor. Not researched here [unverified].
20. Standardized cue library vs free-form LLM. The literature supports checklists [34], not unconstrained generation.
21. Team roles (Navarrete / Kazior / Beltoja) and who owns IRB vs hardware vs sim-center access. Named in committed docs; not re-verified this session [unverified].
22. Deck (`Cognitive-Companion-Presentation.pptx`) exists. This pack does not audit whether the deck still says Crisis Mirror, $299 Halo, or “camera-free Halo” [unverified].

## Recommended next actions (not implementation)

- Sergio: answer 1, 2, 8, 12, 14. Those five change the protocol [unverified].
- Link / Coder: do not start firmware work until (1) is a written decision [unverified].
- Counsel / HRPP: 10-minute VIRBs determination request using the privacy note [15] [16].
- Researcher: stop. Pack is on disk. No PR.

## What would close the pack later

- A vendor email or photo of G2 audio-out [unverified].
- A Brilliant firmware note that the camera pipeline can be compiled out [unverified].
- VCU HRPP determination letter (exempt / QI / convened) [unverified].
- One methods paragraph: primary endpoint (process adherence vs time-to-cue vs NASA-TLX) [unverified].
